# web-portfolio

My web portfolio made using ReactJS, Sass, and Framer Motion

```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```

## Deployment notes
Using
```
npm run build
```
messes up with file paths, I don't know why. For the fix, edit the index.html in the dist folder and remove "/web-portfolio" from the filepaths for the index.css and index.js files.
